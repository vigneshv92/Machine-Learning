    "# Refactor: Wine Quality Analysis\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll refactor code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.\n",
