## What's Ahead?
In this lesson, you're going to get familiar with what's meant by machine learning deployment. Then in the upcoming lessons, you will put these ideas to practice by using Amazon's SageMaker. SageMaker is just one method for deploying machine learning models.

Specifically in this lesson, we will look at answering the following questions:

* What's the machine learning workflow?

* How does deployment fit into the machine learning workflow?

* What is cloud computing?

* Why would we use cloud computing for deploying machine learning models?

* Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?

* What does it mean for a model to be deployed?

* What are the essential characteristics associated with the code of deployed models?

> What are different cloud computing platforms we might use to deploy our machine learning models?
At the end of this lesson, you'll understand the broader idea of machine learning deployment. Then Sean will be guiding you through using SageMaker to deploy your own machine learning models. This is a lot to cover, but by the end you will have a general idea of all the concepts related to deploying machine learning models into real world production systems.

## Notes:
All algorithms used within the machine learning workflow are similar for both the cloud and on-premise computing. The only real difference may be in the user interface and libraries that will be used to execute the machine learning workflow.

For personal use, one’s likely to use cloud services, if they don’t have enough computing capacity.

With academic use, quite often one will use the university’s on-premise computing resources, given their availability. For smaller universities or research groups with few funding resources, cloud services might offer a viable alternative to university computing resources.

For workplace usage, the amount of cloud resources used depends upon an organization’s existing infrastructure and their vulnerability to the risks of cloud computing. A workplace may have security concerns, operational governance concerns, and/or compliance and legal concerns regarding cloud usage. Additionally, a workplace may already have on-premise infrastructure that supports the workflow; therefore, making cloud usage an unnecessary expenditure. Keep in mind, many progressive companies may be incorporating cloud computing into their business due to the business drivers and benefits of cloud computing.
