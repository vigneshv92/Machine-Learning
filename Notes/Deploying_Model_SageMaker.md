## Deploying a Model in SageMaker

[Deployment](https://youtu.be/g_GYZpcVcFE)

In this lesson, we're going to take a look at how we can use a model that has been created in SageMaker. We will do this by first deploying our model. For us, this means using SageMaker's functionality to create an endpoint that will be used as a way to send data to our model.

> Recall, from the first lesson in this section, that an endpoint is basically a way to allow a model and an application to communicate. An application, such as a web app, will be responsible for accepting user input data, and through an endpoint we can send that data to our model, which will produce predictions that can be sent back to our application!
