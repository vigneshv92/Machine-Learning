## Course Outline
Throughout this course, we’ll be focusing on deployment tools and the machine learning workflow; answering a few big questions along the way:

* How do you decide on the correct machine learning algorithm for a given task?
* How can we utilize cloud ML services in SageMaker to work with interesting datasets or improve our algorithms?
To approach these questions, we’ll go over a number of real-world case studies, and go from task and problem formulation to deploying models in SageMaker. We’ll also utilize a number of SageMaker’s built-in algorithms.

## Case Studies
Case studies are in-depth examinations of specific, real-world tasks. In our case, we’ll focus on three different problems and look at how they can be solved using various machine learning strategies. The case studies are as follows:
