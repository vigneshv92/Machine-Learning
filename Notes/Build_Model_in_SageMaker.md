## What is AWS Sagemaker?

AWS (or Amazon) SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides the ability to build, train, tune, deploy, and manage large-scale machine learning (ML) models quickly. Sagemaker provides tools to make each of the following steps simpler:

* Explore and process data
* Retrieve
* Clean and explore
* Prepare and transform
* Modeling
* Develop and train the model
* Validate and evaluate the model
* Deployment
* Deploy to production
* Monitor, and update model & data

The Amazon Sagemaker provides the following tools:

* Ground Truth - To label the jobs, datasets, and workforces
* Notebook - To create Jupyter notebook instances, configure the lifecycle of the notebooks, and attache Git repositories
* Training - To choose an ML algorithm, define the training jobs, and tune the hyperparameter
* Inference - To compile and configure the trained models, and endpoints for deployments
